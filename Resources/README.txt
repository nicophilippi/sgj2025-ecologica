DISPLAYING A TILE 
1. BASE TEXTURE     - Display base texture (Grass_Texture.png => 5th texture)
2. OFFSET           - Make a vertikal offset related to the height of the tile
3. GRASS TEXTURE    - Display the corresponding texture, that matches the vegetation
					   (Grass_Texture.png => texture 1 - 4)
4. WATER RESCOURCES - Display the amount of Water available
5. SPECIES          - Display the corresponding picture that matches the species

POSSIBLE CARDS:
1. Lift a Hill      - Lift a big area around selected tile a little
2. Lift a Mountain  - Lift a small area around selected tile by a lot
3. Nuclear strike   - Decrease area around selected tile in form of a crater and 
					  transform it to wasteland
4. Rain period      - Increase humidity around selected tile
5. Drought period   - Decrease humidity around selected tile
6. Lightning strike - Kill everything on selected tile 

IMAGE FILES:
1. Grass_Texture.png
The image contains 5 textures (16x16 pixels).
The first 4 are different stadiums of grass, the last one has to be displayed under the tiles, to give a sense of depth, if the tile is higher than its neighbors.
